Problem Statement

This project focuses on analyzing electric vehicle (EV) charging data to explore user behavior, energy consumption, and charging trends. By applying data analysis and machine learning techniques, the goal is to identify factors affecting charging duration, cost, and energy use. The project also aims to predict charging patterns and optimize charging efficiency based on variables like vehicle model, charger type, time of day, and user type.
